class Stream (Tradier):
	"""
	The Stream class provides a method to connect and stream market data in real time using Tradier's API.
	This class extends the Tradier base class and utilizes both HTTP and WebSocket protocols to establish
	a connection, send subscription requests, and produce incoming market events.

	Note - Per Tradier's documentation, WebSocket streaming is only available via live trading.
		   Ergo, when instantiating the class object, you need to supply the third argument live_trade with its value set to True.

	Attributes:
	- MARKET_STREAM_ENDPOINT (str): API endpoint for market event streaming.
	- ACCOUNT_STREAM_ENDPOINT (str): API endpoint for account event streaming.
	- MARKET_EVENTS_STREAM_ENDPOINT (str): API endpoint for specific market events.

	Methods:
	- stream_market_events: Initiates market event streaming for specified symbols.
	- http_market_stream_connect: Establishes an HTTP connection to get a streaming session ID.
	- ws_market_connect: Connects to a WebSocket to receive and handle live market data.
